What We Did:
Built a Chrome Extension that tracks the amount of time a user spends on different websites. It uses chrome.tabs API to detect active sites and classifies them into productive/unproductive. A dashboard displays this usage via charts using Chart.js.

 Tools Used:
Frontend (Popup & Dashboard): HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Browser Platform: Chrome Extensions API (Manifest v3)

Storage: chrome.storage.local (to persist site-wise time)

Data Visualization: Chart.js for productivity graphs

 Why This is Applicable:
Browser extensions are an expanding field â€” from productivity apps like RescueTime to SEO and privacy tools. This project demonstrates how to build mini-apps that run inside the browser, track user behavior, and provide insights visually. It uses event-driven scripting and data visualization, which are highly relevant for analytics, marketing tech, and personal monitoring tools. **
